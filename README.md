### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# MySQL Slave Replication Lag
---

MySQL Slave Replication Lag is an incident that occurs when there is a delay or lag in the replication of data from the master MySQL server to the slave MySQL server. This can happen due to various reasons such as network latency, high load on the master server, or configuration issues. This can lead to data inconsistency and affect the overall performance of the application or service that relies on the MySQL database.

### Parameters
```shell
# Environment Variables

export USERNAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export MASTER_SERVER="PLACEHOLDER"

export SLAVE_SERVER="PLACEHOLDER"

export SLAVE_MYSQL_SERVER_IP="PLACEHOLDER"

export MASTER_MYSQL_SERVER_IP="PLACEHOLDER"

```

## Debug

### Check MySQL service status
```shell
systemctl status mysql
```

### Verify if replication is running and check its status
```shell
mysql -u ${USERNAME} -p -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G"
```

### Check the log files of both the master and slave servers
```shell
tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log
```

### Check the network connectivity and latency between the master and slave servers
```shell
ping ${MASTER_SERVER}

ping ${SLAVE_SERVER}

traceroute ${MASTER_SERVER}

traceroute ${SLAVE_SERVER}
```

### Check the load on the master server
```shell
top
```

### Check the MySQL configuration files on both servers
```shell
cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

### Check the disk usage and available space on both servers
```shell
df -h
```

### Check the MySQL version and compare it on both servers
```shell
mysql -u ${USERNAME} -p -e "SELECT VERSION();"
```
### Measure the replication lag of a MySQL database
```shell
mysql -u ${USERNAME} -p -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G" | grep Seconds_Behind_Master | awk '{print $2}'

```
## Repair

### Define variables
```shell
MASTER_SERVER=${MASTER_MYSQL_SERVER_IP}

SLAVE_SERVER=${SLAVE_MYSQL_SERVER_IP}
```

### Check network connectivity
```shell
ping -c 3 $MASTER_SERVER > /dev/null 2>&1

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

    echo "Network connectivity between master and slave MySQL servers is OK."

else

    echo "Network connectivity between master and slave MySQL servers is not OK."

fi
```

### Check the configuration of the MySQL replication process and ensure that it is correctly set up.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash

# Stop the MySQL service

sudo systemctl stop mysql.service

# Backup the my.cnf file

sudo cp /etc/mysql/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf.bak

# Edit the my.cnf file

sudo sed -i 's/^server-id/#server-id/' /etc/mysql/my.cnf

sudo sed -i 's/^log_bin/#log_bin/' /etc/mysql/my.cnf

sudo sed -i 's/^binlog_do_db/#binlog_do_db/' /etc/mysql/my.cnf

sudo sed -i 's/^replicate_do_db/#replicate_do_db/' /etc/mysql/my.cnf

# Start the MySQL service

sudo systemctl start mysql.service

echo "MySQL replication configuration has been checked and updated."

```
